## Movie Time

I built this application to practice integrating a third party API with a react application and to learn more about sessions and authentication. This application is built using ReactJS and The Movie Database API for movie data. The key features are displaying top 100 trending movies, searching for movies, data pagination, session based authentication using TMDB user account, and adding and removing movies from a watchlist.
